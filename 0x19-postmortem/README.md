Duration: Start Time: 2023-02-05, 9:00 AM (UTC-8) End Time: 2023-02-05, 11:00 AM (UTC-8)

Impact: The website experienced an outage, resulting in all users unable to access the website and its services. Approximately 100% of users were affected.

Root Cause: The outage was caused by a failure in the database server, resulting in a complete system breakdown.

Timeline:

9:00 AM - The issue was detected by the monitoring system, which raised an alert.

9:15 AM - The incident was escalated to the operations team who started investigating the issue.

9:30 AM - The operations team initially assumed that the issue was due to a network failure and started investigating the network infrastructure.

10:00 AM - After investigating the network, it was determined that the issue was not with the network. The team then shifted their focus to the database server.

10:30 AM - The database server was found to be the root cause of the issue. The database had reached its maximum capacity and was unable to handle any more requests, leading to a complete system failure.

11:00 AM - The issue was resolved by increasing the capacity of the database server and restarting the system.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a failure in the database server, which was unable to handle the increased number of requests. This was due to the database reaching its maximum capacity. The issue was resolved by increasing the capacity of the database server and restarting the system.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

The following measures can be implemented to prevent similar outages in the future:

Monitor the database server regularly to ensure it has enough capacity to handle the increased number of requests.
Implement auto-scaling for the database server to automatically increase its capacity when necessary.
Regularly perform capacity planning to ensure the database has enough resources to handle future growth.
Tasks to address the issue:

Implement database server monitoring.
Implement auto-scaling for the database server.
Perform regular capacity planning for the database server.
